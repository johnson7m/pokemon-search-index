Pokemon Search Index (Vanilla JavaScript)


This is a pokemon search engine using freeCodeCamp's pokeApi 
Notes: 
1.) Local files include blank app/reportWebVitals.js files. This is because I created ths local variant (used to be a repl) with npx create-react-app since that's what I've been using. React has to see those other two files in order run the local files
2.) fun project, I have a second version that is technically more efficient but this is the version that was needed to pass the test suite.
3.) Just download local files and npx create-react-app. Replace all files with the files in these folders
4.) run npm start in a terminal envinroment.
